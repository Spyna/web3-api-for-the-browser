# Web3 API for the browser.

This project contains the [smart contract](packages/smart-contract) and the [dApp](packages/dapp) demo, developed for the talk *Web3 API for the browser*. 

## About the talk

In the beginning, there was the Web, then Web 2.0, and today, Web 3.0. But what does it mean? And more importantly, why is it interesting for us developers? And again, if they called it Web3, does that mean it runs on the browser?

Yes and no: one part runs on the browser and the other on the blockchain. In this talk, we will answer this and other questions concerning the world of Web3 and the revolution that brought it the name 3.0.

Any JavaScript developer will see how to create a dApp in plain JavaScript, an application that runs on a browser and uses the blockchain as a back-end.

By the end of this talk, you will not only discover Web3 but also that it is a real opportunity for developers. Don't miss your chance to be part of this amazing evolution of the Web!
